### BUT (Bachelor University of Technology)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Projets-BUT-Informatique repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during the first two years of my studies at Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord. This repository showcases both individual and group projects, allowing me to develop valuable skills in both teamwork and autonomy.

## Repository Content
The repository includes a diverse range of projects, covering various aspects of computer science. Each project highlights my growth and progress throughout my academic journey. I have tackled these assignments with dedication, employing my knowledge and creativity to deliver quality results.

## Collaborative Projects
Some of the projects in this repository were completed in collaboration with my peers. Working in a group setting provided me with valuable experiences in teamwork, effective communication, and collaborative problem-solving. Together, we successfully navigated challenges and leveraged our collective strengths to achieve outstanding outcomes.

## Individual Projects
In addition to group projects, I have also undertaken individual projects within this repository. These solo endeavors have allowed me to cultivate a sense of autonomy and self-reliance. By working independently, I honed my ability to manage projects from inception to completion, making critical decisions and exploring innovative solutions along the way.

## Conclusion
The Projets-BUT-Informatique repository serves as a testament to my growth as a computer science student. Through collaborative and individual projects, I have developed a comprehensive skill set, encompassing both teamwork and autonomy. Feel free to explore the repository and witness the results of my dedication and passion for computer science.
